NoMouseAllowed nudges the user towards using the keyboard by discouraging the use of the mouse.
It lowers the screen brightness when you use your mouse.
The brightness gets restored after 6 seconds.
You can choose wether you want to discourage clicking, moving or scrolling.

Pull Requests are welcome.

NoMouseAllowed was inspired by [NoMouse](https://github.com/brhs/nomouse).
